description: "Lady Windermere's Fan, A Play About a Good Woman is a four-act comedy\
  \ by Oscar Wilde, first produced 22 February 1892 at the St James's Theatre in London.\
  \ The play was first published in 1893. Like many of Wilde's comedies, it bitingly\
  \ satirizes the morals of society.\nThe story concerns Lady Windermere, who suspects\
  \ that her husband is having an affair with another woman. She confronts him with\
  \ it but although he denies it, he invites the other woman, Mrs Erlynne, to his\
  \ wife's birthday ball. Angered by her husband's supposed unfaithfulness, Lady Windermere\
  \ decides to leave her husband for another lover. After discovering what has transpired,\
  \ Mrs Erlynne follows Lady Windermere and attempts to persuade her to return to\
  \ her husband and in the course of this, Mrs Erlynne is discovered in a compromising\
  \ position. It is then revealed Mrs Erlynne is Lady Windermere's mother, who abandoned\
  \ her family twenty years before the time the play is set. Mrs Erlynne sacrifices\
  \ herself and her reputation to save her daughter's marriage. The best known line\
  \ of the play sums up the central theme:\n\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of\
  \ us are looking at the stars.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
